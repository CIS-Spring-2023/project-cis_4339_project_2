# Data Platform Frontend

This project uses [VueJS 3](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
For form validation [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/) is used.

## Project setup

    npm install

### Before startup
You need to either have a local backend running and or use a cloud deployed backend.

Setup a .env file with following variables, e.g.:

    VITE_ROOT_API=http://localhost:3000

VITE_ROOT_API is the URL for the backend API, either on localhost or in the cloud.
